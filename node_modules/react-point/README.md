[`react-point`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-point) is a small, focused click/tap component for React.

A `<PointTarget>` normalizes click and click-like touch events (not swipes or drags) into a "point event". This helps you avoid the 300ms delay for click events on touch interfaces like iOS.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-point

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel
import PointTarget from 'react-point'

// not using an ES6 transpiler
var PointTarget = require('react-point')
```

The UMD build is also available on [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com):

```html
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/react-point/umd/react-point.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactPoint`.

## Usage

Just render a `<PointTarget>` component and give it an `onPoint` function to call whenever the user clicks or taps the element.

```js
import React from 'react'
import PointTarget from 'react-point'

class App extends React.Component {
  handlePoint() {
    alert('I was clicked or tapped!')
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <PointTarget onPoint={this.handlePoint}/>
    )
  }
}
```

By default, a `<PointTarget>` renders a `<button>` for accessibility. However, you can use the [`children` prop](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/children-props-type.html) to make it render something else. For example, to render a `<div>`:

```js
import React from 'react'
import PointTarget from 'react-point'

class App extends React.Component {
  handlePoint() {
    alert('I was clicked or tapped!')
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <PointTarget onPoint={this.handlePoint}>
        <div>Click or tap here</div>
      </PointTarget>
    )
  }
}
```

*Note:* The `onClick`, `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`, and `onTouchCancel` props will be overwritten because `<PointTarget>` needs them to do its thing).

That's it :) Enjoy!
